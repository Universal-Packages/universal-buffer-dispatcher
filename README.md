With the wonders of asynchronous routines in JavaScript you can achieve more performant and smooth applications, but sometimes you just want to take it easy with all the racing and make sure all you async tasks are still asynchronous from the rest of your application but not from other tasks, for example a task that mutates a state in a particular way, you want to give it a chance of mutating it in all the ways it needs to before another tasks mutastes it from another part of you app.
